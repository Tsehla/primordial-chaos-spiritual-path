Even when u get lost u could tell with this approach when i was comparing to the one I have being using which felt more like being in a battle field where anything can happen so u have to be self reliant to keep progressing en improving.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that the trick, being aware of ur progress towards ur goal en being able to calculate exactly how u progressing en if u are just progressing in a circle or actual gaining new ground en covering en refining all u need to ensure future progress.\r\n\r\nThis is also why my methods are like like science to some extent as spirituality doesn't follow logic like since hence chaotic. But u can pick en choose elements from anything en patch them in there so long ubare convinced they will assist u in ur progress, after all everything goes so long it harms not or suppress all other beings of all types, sizes en nature",
