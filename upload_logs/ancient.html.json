  "text": "Being a leader mean to be a servant, u always the last in everything good en the first in everything bad, this is because u role is to ensure all are taken care of en content as such there's no rest for you before all are rested en there's no happy for you before all are happy. \r\n\r\nBasically it sucks en if a leader is happy than those whom he/she lead it means they are not the servant but are the one served, Basically it means many are suffering for the benefit of one \"a pyramid\" instead of one suffering for the upliftment of many \"inverse pyramid\". \r\n\r\nIn both cases there's suffering the difference is its scale this is why the best leadership style to remove suffering much possible is one where there's no leader because everyone is a leader and everyone is working for benefits of everyone,  no one deserve to suffer, suffering is not something meant to exist or be forever.\r\n\r\nThis is why I can't be a leader because I can't be a servant at this point im too broken this body is barely holding on even if I decide to improve the body the mental is tired so many things require improvement en upgrade en im not exactly willing to walk that path en battle, hence I rather all become leaders not necessarily leaders of others but leaders of themselves after all leading myself has shown how one can get far themselves even better because they understands themselves better so long they keep improving en moving on never stopping no matter how slow.",
