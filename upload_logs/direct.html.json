The challenge lies not in the act, but in your ability to truly believe and feel.\r\n\r\n1. Believe completely\r\nAccept without doubt that your loved one is still alive — just existing in a different place, which I call the spirit world.\r\nOthers may call it heaven, hell, or something else — but these are only names for the same destination. What people call heaven and hell are not fixed places, but states of experience — one of comfort, one of discomfort. Both can exist in the same realm.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Remember them vividly\r\nThink of them often, especially in moments of quiet.\r\nFocus on pleasant memories and moments of warmth.\r\nImagine them in their best and happiest form — or simply allow them to appear as they believe is their best. Avoid forcing an image upon them; instead, see them as they wish to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Yearn deeply\r\nLet your heart truly desire reunion.\r\nFeel the wish to see them, speak with them, or simply know they are well.\r\nYour yearning should be pure — not for your own comfort, but for their peace.\r\n...Attached FILE",
