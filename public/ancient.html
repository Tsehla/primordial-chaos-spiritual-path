      <h2>Important Note</h2>
      <p>
        My path has been of absolute extreme power, my loyalty is to life, life of all kinds. No, I'm not a good person so I ask one thing only: do not harm or suppress life in all its forms, directly or notâ€”after all, we are connected as one.<br><br>
        Everything in here is to be treated as a loose recommendation or guide. The path changes, the destination moves. What I record is what the path was when I passed there, not necessarily what it is now when you start walking it. For example, when I walked in some areas there were no footprints, but as I passed, mine were left behind. What I record may not mention a path with footprints or a path at all, as all I saw was no path before me in some places.<br><br>
        I hope and recommend as you walk your path you also record and share your experiences with others so they can have more points of reference as they walk their path or start to, like I do for you.<br><br>
        <b>P.S.</b> You will likely find misspelling and bad word order. Well, deal with it. I had my difficulties. If you can't even solve that, then doing so will prepare you for something. Hence, I barely bother with things' accuracy so long as the main point is passed along.<br>
        Besides, IF I HAVE TIME TO FIX SPELLING MISTAKES THEN I HAVE TIME TO PONDER SPIRITUAL ISSUES AND MEDITATE. As such, if you have time to complain, then you have time to get stronger spiritually.<br><br>
        <b>P.S. 2</b> My path is of power. This has mostly to do with not being able to be patient while watching others suffer and lacking the ability to remove their suffering. My path wasn't always like this, but not far from it either. As such, you don't have to be like mine, but know WEAKNESS is NOT GOOD in the CURRENT SPIRIT WORLD. Don't discard who you are, but improve and be able to withstand storms and destroy skies.

        P.S 3
        
        You will need to shed a lot if not all you know with this path of [ mastery ] basically you havbe to recreate urself en discard all that was not chosen or created by you of you. Lets meet on the other side...

<summary>Being a leader mean to be a servant,...</summary>

<br>
<br>
<br>Being a leader mean to be a servant, u always the last in everything good en the first in everything bad, this is because u role is to ensure all are taken care of en content as such there's no rest for you before all are rested en there's no happy for you before all are happy. 
<br>
<br>Basically it sucks en if a leader is happy than those whom he/she lead it means they are not the servant but are the one served, Basically it means many are suffering for the benefit of one "a pyramid" instead of one suffering for the upliftment of many "inverse pyramid". 
<br>
<br>In both cases there's suffering the difference is its scale this is why the best leadership style to remove suffering much possible is one where there's no leader because everyone is a leader and everyone is working for benefits of everyone,  no one deserve to suffer, suffering is not something meant to exist or be forever.
<br>
<br>This is why I can't be a leader because I can't be a servant at this point im too broken this body is barely holding on even if I decide to improve the body the mental is tired so many things require improvement en upgrade en im not exactly willing to walk that path en battle, hence I rather all become leaders not necessarily leaders of others but leaders of themselves after all leading myself has shown how one can get far themselves even better because they understands themselves better so long they keep improving en moving on never stopping no matter how slow.</span>
